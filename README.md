GTPE Data Science Boot Camp Module 15 Challenge

Repository contains 2 folders: Leaflet_Part-1 and Starter_Code. May contain Leaflet_Part-2 in the future.

Starter_Code contains boot camp-provided starter files that I used as a sandbox.

Leaflet_Part-1 contains an index.html that shows the Leaflet plot and a static folder. 
The static folder contains the logic.js code for the Leaflet plot as well as a css style file that I did not touch at all.
